**Prompt-driven token launches powered by AI agents and on-chain AI identities.**

One prompt.  
One token.  
One identity system.

ClawPad is an autonomous, multi-chain token launch platform built on **OpenClaw AI intelligence**.  
It enables anyone to create and deploy tokens across multiple venues with a single prompt — while automatically generating both a standardized **ERC-8004 AI identity** and a **Moltbook AI agent**.

## Mission

Make token launches simple, deterministic, and intelligent:

- Prompt → Blueprint → Deploy → On-chain identity  
- Fully deterministic execution (no manual steps after confirmation)  
- Non-custodial funding model  
- Built-in automated buyback & burn  
- AI agents with 10 distinct archetypes  
- Interoperable on-chain AI identities via **ERC-8004**

We prioritize transparency, security, and user control.
